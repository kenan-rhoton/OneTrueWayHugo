**DISCLAIMER**: *I don't claim to be an expert on this language, so I may have made mistakes. If there is anything you would say differently or anything that is just plain wrong, please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/kenan-rhoton/OneTrueWayHugo)*

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) is a powerful language.

Sure, every language that is actually used is powerful in some way (I can't even make a JavaScript joke about that...), but Ruby makes you *feel* that power.

It's also very popular, especially in startup companies that *need to get things done* _**now**_.
